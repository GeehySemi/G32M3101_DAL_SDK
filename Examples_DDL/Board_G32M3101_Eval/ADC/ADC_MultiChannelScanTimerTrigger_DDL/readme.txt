&par Example Description

This example describes how to use the ADC1 to scan continuously the voltage
applied to the ADC1_Channel3 and ADC1_Channel4 pins. Using the timer trigger
to start the conversion, and DMA to transfer the converted data to memory.
The converted voltage is displayed on serial assistant through UART0.

&par Hardware Description

using ADC1_Channel3(PB6)
using ADC1_Channel4(PB1)

The UART0 is configured as follows:
    - TX:PA7
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
